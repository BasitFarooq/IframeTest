				<h1 id="faq56">Kids Privacy Policy</h1>
				
				
		<h6>Does K2PS offer a Kids Privacy Policy?</h6> <P>  
K2PS adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) that requires we (a) inform parents and legal guardian about how we collect, use and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age, (b) obtain the prior verifiable consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of the site, (c) do not collect more information than is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in a given activity on this site and (d) provide parents with the ability to review and delte the information collected about their kids. When we discuss “kids” in this Kids Policy, we mean children uder 13 years of age. When we use the term ‘parent” in theis Kids Policy, we mean to include legal guardians. </p>
<h6>What types of personal information do you collect from kids?</h6> <P>
This Kids Policy uses the terms “personally identifiable information” and “personal information” synonymously. When we use either, we mean information that specifically identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, e-mail address, postal address or phone number and any demographic or other information about a user, such as gender or a user’s number of children, when such information is directly associated with personally identifiable information. </p>
<P>Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. </p>
<h6>What is Direct Collection?</h6> <P>
We believe that the user experience is safest for kids when they are not able to enter personal information into the Site. Kids can surf the site and view sample content, but kids are eligible to maintain only a limited access account, which does not allow any personal information to be entered into the Site. With limited access accounts, kids cannot access certain interactive features located on the Site in connection with which kids would be able provide personal information, such as chat rooms, instant messaging, e-mail, message boards or forums and other similar interactive activities (the “Interactive Activities”). </p>
<h6>What happens when you know a user is attempting to register for K2PS as a kid?</h6> <P>
We do not allow that kid to enter personal information, except as permitted in accordance with applicable law (for example, we may collect a kid’s name and email address to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the safety of a child participant on the Site, to protect the security or integrity of the Site, to take precautions against liability, to respond to judicial process or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on matters related to public safety). </p>
<h6>Are their exceptions?</h6> <P>
We may collect a kid’s email address to respond to certain specific requests or inquiries (such as answering a child’s question, requesting a subscription to an online newsletter or signing up for a contest), provided that in certain circumstances we may be required to notify parents that we have collected such information and give parents the opportunity to request that we make no further use of such information. Additionally, Kids2Pro may provide the “limited access account” kid with the ability to participate in any of the weplay marketing and/or promotional programs in which the data collected is used only for internal purposes (where no information is shared or publicly disclosed). This may require an email sent to parents requesting their affirmative consent. </p>
<h6>Do you collect any passive information?</h6> <P>
Please see the “Automatically Collected Information” section of our general Privacy Policy to learn about information that is passively collected on our Site through technology such as cookies. </p>
<h6>How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we have collected about kids?</h6> <P>
We use personal information from kids to complete transactions requested by them, to provide customer services, to customize and develop our products or services, to respond to questions, problems or complaints, to request feedback, to send administrative communications, promotional materials (including special offers and promotions) and information about our products and service, and for other specified purposes for which the personal information was provided and any purpose relating thereto. Please see our general Privacy Policy for a more detailed description of the use of personally identifiable information</p>
<h6>What is your policy on sharing personal information?</h6> <P>
We do not share any personal information about kids with any third parties other than (a) third-party service providers and consultants ("Service Providers") who assist us in performing internal functions in connection with the operation of our business, such as fulfilling orders, processing payments or other information, assisting in verifying parental consent and complying with other applicable regulations, performing internal analysis of the Site or administering surveys on our behalf, (b) in connection with mergers and business transfers as set forth in our general Privacy Policy, and (c) disclosures required by law and to help protect the rights, security and safety of the Site, Weplay, our users or others, as set forth in our general Privacy Policy. </p>
<P>Service Providers have agreed not to use or retain personal information obtained in connection with the Site for any purpose other than to carry out the services for us and to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of all such personal information obtained in connection with the site. </p>

<h6>What happens when something is posted on the Message Board?</h6> 
<p>Parents and kids should note that any information that kids post to message boards or other Interactive Activities will be accessible by other users of the Interactive Activities with whom the kids allows to access their profile and could be used to send the kid, or anyone else identified in the information posted by the kid, unsolicited messages. Kids should not post any personally identifiable information, including, without limitation, names, phone numbers, or email addresses, in connection with any Interactive Activities. Parents should talk to their children about not posting personal information in connection with their participation in Interactive Activities on the Site. </p>
<h6>Do Parents have the right to consent to our collection of personal information?</h6> <P>

Parents have the right to consent to our collection and use of personal information from their without also consenting to our disclosure of such information to third parties (except for disclosures to third parties who provide support fo the internal operations of the Site and who do not use or disclose that information for any other purpose) </p>

<h6>Are there other instances when parents would be notified?</h6> <P>
Parents will be given the opportunity to exercise this right if their kids' actions on the site trigger an email to the parents requesting any parental consent (as discussed above). Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a kid’s participation in an online activity on the kid’s providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary</p>
<h6>How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of information from their kids?</h6> <P>
If a kid attempts to register and indicates that his or her age is under 13, the account will automatically be flagged as a limited access account that restricts access to certain weplay features, and we will ask the kid to provide us with his or her first name and a parent’s email address so that we may contact a parent to request consent in the event the kid takes any action on the Site that would require entry of personal information (as discussed above). In the event the kid takes any such action on the Site, we will then send an email to the parent’s email address containing our notice to parents of our practices regarding use, collection and disclosure of personal information about kids (the “Notice to Parents”) and requesting verifiable consent to collection of the kid’s personal information as outlined in the Notice to Parents. </p>
<h6>Will you retain the parent’s email address for a reasonable time to allow the parent to consent to collection of the kid’s personal information?</h6> <P>
Yes, and we will also provide a means for parents to authenticate themselves if they desire access to the child’s account. If the parent does not provide consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the email address and we will not collect any personal information from the kid. </p>
<h6>How can parents review, change or delete personal information collected from their kids?</h6> <P> 
Parents have the right to review and have deleted from our records personal information collected from their kids. Further, at any time parents may refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their kids. To change or delete account information that we have collected from their kids, parents must contact us by sending an e-mail to privacy@kids2pro.com. Parents should please include the child’s username and their own e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist with any such inquiry or request. </p>
<h6>How will we notify parents if our Kids Privacy Policy changes?</h6> <P>
We reserve the right to amend this Kids Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share kids’ personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Kids Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. </p>
